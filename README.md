# 🛡️ Cybersecurity: Hacker vs Defender Simulation 💻

An interactive web-based game that demonstrates the **Minimax algorithm** in a fun, cybersecurity-inspired way.  
Players take the role of the **Defender**, placing protections like firewalls and patches. The AI plays as the **Hacker**, using **Minimax** to find the best attack strategy and try to break through your defenses.  



## 🚀 Features
- 🎮 **Interactive Game**: Defender vs Hacker showdown.  
- 🧠 **AI with Minimax**: Hacker uses Minimax algorithm to pick the best moves.  
- 🔒 **Cybersecurity Theme**: Defenses include firewall, patching, closing ports.  
- 🌐 **Browser-Based**: Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no install needed).  



## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript  
- **Algorithm**: Minimax (commonly used in AI & decision-making)  
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages / Vercel (easy one-click hosting)  



## 📖 How It Works
1. **Defender Turn** → Player places a defense (firewall, patch, or block).  
2. **Hacker Turn (AI)** → The Hacker uses **Minimax** to calculate the strongest attack path.  
3. This repeats until:  
   - The Hacker breaks through all defenses (**Hacker Wins**).  
   - The Defender survives the attack sequence (**Defender Wins**).  



## 🎯 Purpose
This project is built for hackathons & learning purposes to **visualize AI decision-making in cybersecurity**.  
It makes a serious topic **fun + interactive**, while showcasing real AI foresight (Minimax).
