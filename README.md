## 📖 Overview  

**Hacker vs Defender** is a simple yet engaging text-based Python game that simulates a cyber battle between an attacker (Hacker) and a defender (Security Professional).  
The game is designed as a beginner-friendly project to practice **Python concepts** like loops, conditionals, functions, and user input handling.  

Players take turns making strategic moves — the Hacker attempts to breach systems while the Defender counters with security measures. Each round tests decision-making, as the outcome depends on chosen actions and random elements, making every playthrough different.  

This project not only demonstrates **game logic and flow control** but also introduces **cybersecurity concepts** in a fun and interactive way.
